**Which of the following is not a valid C++ variable name? (There may be
more than one.)**
1. `i_think_i_am_valid`
2. `i_may_have_2_many digits_2_be_valid`
3. `_I_start_and_end_with_underscores`
4. `I_Have_A_Dollar_$ign`
5. `I AM_LONG_AND_HAVE_NO_LOWER_CASE_LETTERS`

#####Answer:
All of them are legal. But regarding **no. 3**,
Although it is legal to start a variable name with an underscore, it is best to avoid
this practice, since some C++ compilers use this convention for defining their own
internal identifiers.
