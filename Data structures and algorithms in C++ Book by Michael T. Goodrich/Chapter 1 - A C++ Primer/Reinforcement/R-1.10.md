**What (if anything) is different about the behavior of the following two
functions `f` and `g` that increment a variable and print its value?**
```C++
void f(int x)
{ 
    std::cout << ++x; 
}

void g(int& x)
{ 
    std::cout << ++x; 
}
```
#####Answer:
`void g(int& x)` is taking the value by reference, so the original copy will be
incremented in this case, but `void f(int x)` is taking the arguments by value 
so only a local copy will be incremented.
